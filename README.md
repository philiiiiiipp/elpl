In this assignment, you will build a statistical syntactic parser for English. The PCFG model will be estimated from a treebank (Penn Treebank WSJ) and then applied to new sentences using an efficient polynomial-time parsing algorithm (CKY). The performance of the parser will be evaluated by comparing its predictions to human annotations present in the treebank. You are provided with source code for a baseline (but not quite complete) parser which you will modify to make it fully functional. The project will consist of 2 stages, each with its own deadline (see the web-page or Blackboard for the dates). Make sure you can access the source and data files (on Blackboard).1
